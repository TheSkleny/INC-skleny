# INC

Repository with my solution of INC project in the schoolyear of 2021/2022 on FIT VUT

## Intro :)

This project was designed to introduce us to basics of HW design and basics of VHDL language. It's a project, which everyone forgets about and does it few hours before deadline (me included). Same as this course.
It costed me two nights of mental breakdowns because deadline was right before first examination and this project was neccesary for ending this course succesfully.

## How does it work

I'm doing this repo few months after ending this course, so I don't remember anything about it, only that important files are *uart_fsm.vhd* and *uart.vhd*. Everything else is magic to me now (and was even when I was creating it)

Never again.
